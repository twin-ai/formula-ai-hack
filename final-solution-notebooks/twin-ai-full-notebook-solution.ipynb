Engineers and technicians from every team use weather radar screens, provided by Ubimet to the teams, which allows them to track the current weather and make predictions during the race. Race engineers relay precise information to drivers, including:\n\n- How many minutes until it starts raining\n- Intensity of the rain\n- Which corner will be hit first by the rain\n- Duration of the rain\n\nPoints, and even races sometimes, are won and lost based on making sense of what the weather is going to do during a race, and being prepared as a team to act accordingly.\n\nTherefore, weather forecasting takes a big part on the possible outcome of a race.\n\nSimilarly, F1 2021, the official Formula 1 videogame developed by Codemasters, uses a physics engine that behaves like the real world.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge, we are required to analyse historical weather data from the RedBull Racing eSports team to build a high-performing model that is able to make accurate weather predictions/forecasts.

Therefore, weekend ID is a superset of season ID, indicating that weekend ID captures all the information that weekend ID presents. \n\nFinally, we see that in the third result, both season ID and weekend ID occur exactly once in the session ID group, indicating that session ID captures all the informations that both season ID and weekend ID presents. This makes sense considering that whether the games are played in a weekend, a season, or otherwise, each game is played in session. This provides the justification for which we will be dropping both the season and weekend IDs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.drop(xtremilar_col[:-1], axis=1, inplace=True)\nprint(df.shape)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-05T10:49:57.794952Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-05T10:49:57.795568Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-05T10:49:58.042810Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-05T10:49:57.795518Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-05T10:49:58.041870Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":48,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, let's zoom into the heatmap to observe the top 20 most correlated features with weather","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#### top 20 most correlated features with Weather (correlation matrix) \n\nf, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(25,20))\nk = 20 #number of variables for heatmap\ncols = df.corr().nlargest(k, 'M_WEATHER')['M_WEATHER'].index\ncm = np.corrcoef(df[cols].values.T)\nsns.set(font_scale=1.25)\nhm = sns.heatmap(cm, cbar=True, annot=True, square=True, fmt='.1f', cmap='YlGnBu', annot_kws={'size': 10}, yticklabels=cols.values, xticklabels=cols.values)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-05T10:49:58.044457Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-05T10:49:58.045452Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-05T10:50:08.560146Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-05T10:49:58.045405Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-05T10:50:08.559257Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":49,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Zooming further, we notice a correlated submatrix of 7 features which showed perfect correleration of 1.
