## Objective
Formula 1 is one of the most competitive sports in the world. Engineers and technicians
from every team use weather radar screens, provided by Ubimet to the teams, which allows
them to track the current weather and make predictions during the race. Race engineers
relay precise information to drivers, including:
• How many minutes until it starts raining
• Intensity of the rain
• Which corner will be hit first by the rain
• Duration of the rain
• Points, and even races sometimes, are won and lost based on making sense of what
the weather is going to do during a race, and being prepared as a team to act
accordingly.
Therefore, weather forecasting takes a big part on the possible outcome of a race.
Similarly, F1 2021, the official Formula 1 videogame developed by Codemasters, uses a
physics engine that behaves like the real world.
